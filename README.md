Challenges & Solutions
Challenge 1: Responsive Navigation
Creating a navigation that works seamlessly across all devices was tricky.
Solution: Implemented CSS media queries with a JavaScript toggle for mobile menu. Used Flexbox for desktop and absolute positioning for mobile.

Ensuring elements maintained proper spacing on different screen sizes.
